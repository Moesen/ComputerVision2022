- "Is there a project?"
"There is no self chosen project, only exercises, but some exercises in following weeks are themed the same, so they could be looked at as mini project"



# Actual content - Pinhole camera
## Lecture objectives
Explain homogeneous coordinates, convert to and from homogenous coordinates and eplain pinhole camera

## Pinhole camera
Want to model a cammera, that is accurate and easy to work with
### What is?
Box with tiny whole in wall, will produce projection of whatever light is coming through it.

### Some more
Each pixel in an image corrosponds to a direction of light that hit the camera.

## Perspective transformations
Something
## Euclidian transformations
Something
## Homogenous coordinates
Use 4 numbers to represent a 3D point instead of 3:
`P_h = [spx, spy, spz, s]`
Fourth number `s` is scale. Scale of the homogenous coordinates. If you want to be kind, you use `s=1`.
